After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.","actors":[{"actAs":"Clarice Starling","name":"Jodie Foster"},{"actAs":"Dr. Hannibal Lecter","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"actAs":"FBI Instructor","name":"Lawrence A.

She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax.

Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \"Jessica\", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.","actors":[{"actAs":"Ki Taek","name":"Kang-ho Song"},{"actAs":"Dong Ik","name":"Sun-kyun Lee"},{"actAs":"Yeon Kyo","name":"Yeo-jeong Cho"},{"actAs":"Ki Woo","name":"Woo-sik Choi"},{"actAs":"Ki Jung","name":"So-dam Park"},{"actAs":"Moon Gwang","name":"Lee Jeong-eun"},{"actAs":"Chung Sook","name":"Jang Hye-jin"},{"actAs":"Geun Se","name":"Park Myeong-hoon"},{"actAs":"Da Hye","name":"Ji-so Jung"},{"actAs":"Da Song","name":"Hyun-jun Jung"},{"actAs":"Driver Yoon","name":"Keun-rok Park"},{"actAs":"CEO of Pizza Place","name":"Yi-Seo Jung"},{"actAs":"CEO's Brother of Pizza Place","name":"Jae-myeong Jo"},{"actAs":"Neighbor","name":"Ik-han Jung"},{"actAs":"Drunk Person 1","name":"Kyu-baek Kim"},{"actAs":"Internet Cafe Staff","name":"Hwang In Kyung"},{"actAs":"Street Fighting Person 1","name":"Ahn Seong-Bong"},{"actAs":"Street Fighting Person 2","name":"Kim Jin Hyung"}],"tagline":"Misplaced familyhood (Australia/New Zealand/Singapore)","imdbPageId":"tt6751668","details":{"countries":"South Korea","languages":"Korean, English","releaseDate":"2020-02-07","prodCompanies":"CJ Entertainment, Barunson E&A","filmingLocation":"Jahamun-ro, Buam-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea"},"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Thriller","title":"Parasite","directors":"Bong Joon Ho"},{"runtime":"1hour50minutes","writers":"Luc Besson","boxOffice":{"grossWW":19552640,"budget":115000000,"grossUSC":19501238,"budgetCurrency":"FRF"},"movieId":33,"storyline":"After her father, step-mother, step-sister and little brother are killed by her father's employers, the 12-year-old daughter of an abject drug dealer manages to take refuge in the apartment of a professional hitman who at her request teaches her the methods of his job so she can take her revenge on the corrupt DEA agent who ruined her life by killing her beloved brother.","actors":[{"actAs":"Leon","name":"Jean Reno"},{"actAs":"Stansfield","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"actAs":"Mathilda","name":"Natalie Portman"},{"actAs":"Tony","name":"Danny Aiello"},{"actAs":"Malky","name":"Peter Appel"},{"actAs":"1st Stansfield Man","name":"Willi One Blood"},{"actAs":"2nd Stansfield Man","name":"Don Creech"},{"actAs":"3rd Stansfield Man","name":"Keith A.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.","actors":[{"actAs":"Andrew","name":"Miles Teller"},{"actAs":"Fletcher","name":"J.K.
